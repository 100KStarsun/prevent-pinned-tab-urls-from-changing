# Static Pinned Tabs

Pinned tabs are really cool but don't you hate accidentally navigating away from them?

This extension keeps a pinned tab pinned to a page (using manifest v3).

To install the extension, first download all files to a directory of your choosing, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) or [opera://extensions](opera://extensions), check the "developer mode" box, select "Load unpacked extension...", and point to this directory. That's it!

(This extension isn't on the chrome web store because I don't want to give google $5)

Note: Pages that use AngularX will not work with this extension, but pages that use AngularJS _should_ work with this extension.
Pages that were already pinned when this extension was added will likely need a refresh.
